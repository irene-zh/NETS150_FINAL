Project Name : Wikipedia Racer
Group Members: Kenneth Shinn, Irene Zhang

Project Description : 

This Implementation Project uses BFS and JSoup webscraping to find the "shortest path" from one
Wikipedia article to another using only links on the page/ This program will output this ordered path 
of links to assist a user with Wikipedia Racing.

Project Categories : 
	> Graphs and graph algorithms : We used BFS to find outgoing links to other pages 
									given a Wikipedia page. Also, since Wikipedia itself 
									can be modeled by a directed graph with no edge weights (links
									are one way, serve one purpose, and don't have "costs"),
									BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path between two nodes.
	> Information Networks : We used JSoup for webscraping. Given a wikipedia page, we want
							 a way to retrieve the outgoing links from that page and subsequently
							 turn them into adjacent nodes of the graph.
	
Work Breakdown : 

Although both Irene and Kenneth ended up contributed to both main parts of this project, Kenneth 
mainly worked on the PageNode class (the meat of the webscraping) and Irene mainly worked on the 
BFS class (the meat of the BFS process).

Finally, Irene put it all together through the Main.java class, and Kenneth tested the 
final version of the code.
